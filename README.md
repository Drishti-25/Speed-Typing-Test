A terminal-based speed typing test built using Python and the curses module. It helps users improve their typing speed and accuracy by providing real-time feedback as they type. The application randomly selects a sentence from a text file and displays it for the user to type. It highlights correct and incorrect characters in real-time and calculates the Words Per Minute (WPM) based on typing performance.

## FEATURES
- Real-time WPM (Words Per Minute) calculation.
- Live color-coded typing feedback.
- Random sentence loading from text.txt
- Press ESC anytime to exit

## HOW TO RUN
